**DSNTK** | Decision Toolkit

# Performance

The performance of Decision Toolkit is measured using Rust benchmarks, executed for DMN™ compatibility tests.
This approach gives the feeling how performant this toolkit is.
All benchmarks are executed on a single core of the processor AMD Ryzen 5 4600G.

| version                |    date    | perf<br/>90% | perf<br/>99% |

> Note: When the Decision Toolkit is used as a service,
> then delays related to networking must be taken into consideration
> when estimating the overall performance.
